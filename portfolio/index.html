            <h3>Project Title 2</h3>
            <p>This project aims to enhance railway safety through a predictive analytics system that identifies potential accident risks. By utilizing machine learning algorithms and real-time data from sensors installed on trains and tracks, the system analyzes patterns and anomalies that could indicate impending accidents.

                Key features include automated alerts for maintenance needs, real-time monitoring of train speeds and positions, and predictive modeling for high-risk areas. The goal is to proactively prevent accidents, improve response times, and enhance overall railway safety, ultimately reducing the risk to passengers and freight. This project highlights my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and transportation safety.</p>

            <h3>Project Title 3</h3>
            <p>This project features an interactive chatbot designed to recommend songs based on user preferences and moods. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, the chatbot engages users in conversation to understand their musical tastes and suggest personalized playlists.

                Key functionalities include genre selection, mood detection, and real-time feedback on recommendations. The system pulls data from various music APIs to ensure a diverse range of song choices. This project showcases my skills in AI development, user experience design, and music data integration, providing users with a seamless and enjoyable way to discover new music..</p>
